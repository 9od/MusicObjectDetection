# Music Object Detection Collection

This is the accompanying repository for the Music Object Detection paper and contains the source code for downloading, preprocessing and working with the data, as well as the evaluation code to measure the performance of various music object detectors.

## Downloading the datasets

In this repository we link to [relevant datasets](https://apacha.github.io/OMR-Datasets/), that are used for Music Object Detection:
   
   - [DeepScores](https://tuggeluk.github.io/deepscores/)
   - [MUSCIMA++](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/muscima)
   - [Capitan Collection](https://bitbucket.org/apacha/mensural-detector-database/src/master/)
   
   To download all datasets, simply run `python download_all_datasets.py`
   
## Dataset normalization
After downloading the datasets, you need to make them interoperable with each other. 

To do this, call `python normalize_all_datasets.py`.

We set up the following guidelines and procedures to normalize the datasets, before converting them into specific input formats, needed for various detectors:

- Images are stored as color PNG files with white background and black foreground.
- Annotations are stored as CSV files (comma-separated-values), that must contain a header.

The CSV file should look like the following:

```text
path_to_image,top,left,bottom,right,class_name
mensural/0123.png,100,120,130,142,notehead
mensural/0123.png,12,52,20,72,stem
mensural/0124.png,2,42,100,102,stem
```

an empty file (a file that contains no objects) is represented with a single line without an object:

```text
path/to/empty_image.png,,,,,
```

and for detection results, the very same format is used with one additional column:

```text
path_to_image,top,left,bottom,right,class_name,confidence
mensural/0123.png,100,120,130,142,notehead,0.9752
mensural/0123.png,12,52,20,72,stem,0.5623
mensural/0124.png,2,42,100,102,stem,0.9882
```


## Evaluation

For making fair comparisons of different object detectors, a standard battery of metrics is used, that operates on normalized CSV files.
