# Datasets Normalization

For making multiple datasets interoperable with each other, the following guidelines and procedures are used to normalize the datasets, before converting them into specific input formats, needed for various detectors:

- Images are stored as color PNG files with white background and black foreground.
- Annotations are stored as CSV files (comma-separated-values), that must contain a header.
